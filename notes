current errors: script js first line cant read ID. have to fiure out where handle goes, and what is suppsoed to be labeled id = window

add app icons next to profile pic with links to socials/other platforms (b4 draggable)
make first window (profile window) smaller
sync time and date to desktop for true values
change font at top to be more legible
change fonts for desc
when hovering icons, have a name there to represent what it is: change cursor too to click
custom cursor maybe 
space out the icons to be responsive?
