add a currently listening to spotify thing
sync time and date to desktop for true values (is it suppposed to be delayed when I first start it up? by like 1000ms..)
change font at top to be more legible
change fonts for desc
when hovering icons, have a name there to represent what it is: change cursor too to click
custom cursor maybe
